### Project Description
RoadWise is an interactive web-based road safety simulation designed to educate users about real-life traffic scenarios and safe driving practices. The platform creates a virtual driving environment where users can experience common road situations and learn how to respond correctly.

### The Problem statement
Road accidents are a leading cause of injuries and fatalities, often due to lack of driver awareness and poor understanding of traffic rules. Traditional road safety education is limited and theoretical, failing to provide real-world practice. There is a need for an interactive, engaging solution that helps users learn safe driving through realistic scenarios.

### The Solution
RoadWise provides an interactive, web-based driving simulator where users experience realistic traffic scenarios. It teaches safe driving by simulating lanes, signals, pedestrian crossings, and unexpected events. Users get instant feedback on their actions, helping them learn traffic rules, improve decision-making, and prevent accidents in a fun, practical way.

Traffic signals with violation detection (red/green)
Pedestrian crossings and zebra crossings
Collision detection and real-time warnings
Score tracking for gamified learning
Neon-themed interactive UI

### For Software:

## Implementation
Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kriishna-44/RoadWise.git
# Open index.html in a browser to start
Run

Simply open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
No server setup required as the game is fully front-end.

{ interface when you select 'Bike', whenever you're making a mistake in riding, it will raise an warning message  }

some of the warning messages in both car and bike :
- stop for pedestrian
- vehicle collision
- changing lane
- red traffic signal etc...

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

User interacts with browser → JS logic handles controls, vehicle movement, collisions → localStorage saves selection → Game updates in real-time with requestAnimationFrame.

**Application Workflow:**

Select vehicle → 2. Start game → 3. Navigate lanes & avoid collisions → 4. Score updates → 5. Receive warnings for violations

### Video
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GLMkD86VaP7nE3ZgRLm1QfyW3xgwvlPH/view?usp=drive_link) 
///
The video demonstrates the RoadWise Neon interactive road safety simulator. It starts with the vehicle selection screen, where users can choose a car or bike. After clicking Start Game, the gameplay begins on a virtual road with lanes, traffic signals, and zebra crossings.

Key highlights shown in the video:

Lane navigation: Player controls the vehicle using arrow keys to stay in the correct lane.

Traffic signal interaction: Red and green signals change dynamically; the game issues warnings for red-signal violations.

Pedestrian safety: Pedestrians appear on zebra crossings; users must stop to avoid collisions.

Collision detection: Alerts pop up if the player collides with other vehicles or violates traffic rules.

Scoring system: Real-time score tracking based on distance traveled and safe driving.

Neon-themed UI: Visually engaging interface with animated vehicles and warning messages.

The video showcases the complete user flow, from vehicle selection to gameplay, violations, and scoring, highlighting how the system enforces traffic rules and educates users about safe driving practices.
